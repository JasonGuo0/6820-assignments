The goal is to use Monte Carlo simulation that directly evaluates the Hamiltonian of system to predict the stochastic behavior of a 2D array of atoms.
By tuning the interaction strength D and B, different magnetic phases are acquired and used to train a classifier.
Finally, this classifier is used to classify the phases in a phase diagram, and a support vector machine is employed to plot the boundary.
